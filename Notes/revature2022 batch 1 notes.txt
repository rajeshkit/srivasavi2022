Java:-
	Java is object oriented programming
	class and object
	class -> is a container
		 	-> memebrs - variable, function etc


variable:-
	It is an identity to the memory location
	Types of variable:-
	1. instance variable
		A variable declared inside the class and outside of any 			method
	2. static variable
		A variable declared inside the class and outside of any 			method with the static keyword
	3. local variable
		A variable declared inside the class and inside any 				of the method or inside the block

Functions in java:-
==================
		Used to perform a task or logic
		
		EMI cacluation - task or logic
		
		EMI = P * ROI / TENURE   ---- logic

		Data:-	
		P -> Data -> variable 
		ROI -> Data -> variable
		TENURE -> Data -> variable

		AreaofCircle

		area=PI*R*R;	
		Data:
		PI Data
		R  Data
		area Data	

class and object

	Java is an object oriented programming
	object - real world existing things are called as object
	Object cannot be created directly
	From class you can create an object


	Each Object
		1. property
		2. behaviour

		 1. physical object	2. virtual object
		=========================================
		 trainee		 transaction	
		 creditcard		 deposit
		 customer		 email
		 chair - 
			property - color,size,type,material
			behaviour - move(), sit(), adjustHeight()
		 laptop
		 human
		 lock
		 pen 
			property - colour, size, cost
			behaviour - write(), scrub(), fillInk()
		 note
	
	Revature Online Banking - Java Language - object oriented
	=========================================================
		customer
			property - name,email, phone,gender
			behaviour- applyLoan(),depost(),withdrawl()
		clerk
		manager
		cashier
		withdrawl
		deposit
		cheque
		loan
		creditcard
		debitcard
		salary
		passbook
		
class syntax:-
	
	accessmodifer class Classname{
		members:
		-variable - instance,static,local
		-constructor
		-method - instance, static
	}

Object creation syntax:
======================
	Classname objectname=new Classname();
	Eg:- Customer customer1=new Customer();

Naming convention of java programming:-
======================================
	
	class name - each word starting letter must be in capital
	
	reserved keywords - for, while, do, class, public, switch, static
		* all letters in lowercase
	
	variable name
		- if variable is a single word
			* all letters must be in lowercase
		- if variable has more than one word
			* First word all letters must be in lowercase
			* second word onwards each word starting letter
			  must be in capital
		- if the variable is an constant variable
			* all words letters in capital
	method name
		- if method name is a single word
			* all letters must be in lowercase followed by ()
		- if method name has more than one word
			* First word all letters must be in lowercase
			* second word onwards each word starting letter
			  must be in capital follwed by ()
	interface name - each word starting letter must be in capital
	
	packages name- all letters in must be in smaller letters


https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-namingconventions.html

Instance variable vs Static variable
====================================
	
	scope - will be availabe entire class
	memory - instance heap, static method area
	
	class EMI{
		int a=10;
		static int b=20;
	}
     10 object for EMI each object will have it own copies of a variable
     10 objects for EMI class there is only copy will be created
     static variable is created per class
	
	memory management:
	================== 
	malloc()
	calloc()
	
	Deallocate:-
	===========
	delete()

	In Java Automatic Garbage collection algorithm
	How do we allocate:
	Customer c1=new Customer();
	c1=null;
		
	Java Devloper cannot force garbage collector to collect or clean 
	the memory space. It is works based on the alogrith.
	
	but developer can request garabage collect to clean the space 		alloacted but it is upto the garabage collector

	System.gc()
	Runtime.getRuntime().gc()
	System.runFinalize()


	control statements:-
		Statement:-
			A line terminated with ; is called as statement
	

	Guidelines:-
	===========
		www.revaturebank.com

		com.revaturebank.account
		com.revaturebank.creditcard
		com.revaturebank.cheque
		com.revaturebank.loan

	Packages:-
	==========
	Packages are a way of organizing classes, interfaces, and 		enums in a hierarchical manner. Packages follow a naming 			convention of lowercase characters separated by periods in the 		reverse way you would specify a web domain - thus, 		com.revature.mypackage instead of mypackage.revature.com.

	Access Modfiers:-
		public, private, protected, default - package
		visibility - How far member can be accessable

Variable Scopes:-
	scope -> how far we can access the variable
	lifetime -> how long the variable is there in the memory
	primitive and reference variable	
	1. instance variable
		1.1 primitive instance variable
		1.2 reference instance variable
	2. static variable	
		2.1 primitive static variable
		2.2 reference static variable
	3. local variable
		3.1 primitive local variable
		3.2 reference local variable
	4. block variable

Access Modifiers:-
	
	* visibility
	* private,default,protected,public
	* Places where u can use access modfiers
		1. before class(class level - public, default)
		   [accessmodifier] [nonaccessmodifier] class classname{
			
		   }
		2. before variable declaration(varaible level)
		   
		  [accessmodifier] [nonaccessmodifier] datatype name;
		
		3. before methods(method level)
		   [accessmodifier] [nonaccessmodifier] returntype name(){
		   
                   }
		4. before constructor(constructor)
		   [accessmodifier] classname(){
		   
		   }

Non Access Modifiers:-
	* It changes the default behaviour of the class,variable,method
		static
		final
		abstract
		synchrnized
		transient
		volatilze
		strictfp

Constructor:-
	* constructor is a special memeber function
	* constructor does not need any return type
	* constructor name should be same as class name
	* constrcutor will be call implicitly or automatically soon after 
	  the object is created

Arrays:-
		int mark1
		int mark2
		int mark3
		int mark4	
		int mark5
		int mark6
		int mark7
		int mark8
		int mark9
		int mark10
		int mark11
		int mark12
	
Array - 
	Syntax:
		datatype[] variable=new datatype[size];(Recommended)
		datatype variable[]=new datatype[size];


	Array is a collection of values and of same type which is 			pointed by a variable
		
	Array values can accessed by index 0 to size-1
	
	Array is continous memory allocation
	
	Array size is fixed. you cannot size or decrease the size
	
	Array is a random access

	
	
	  10*32 = 320
			
	int mark[] ---> 78 67 45 87 90 67 99 36 45 78
	
	int a=56;

var args:-(variable length argument)
=========

Casting:-
==========
	1. Type Casting
		converting one primitive type another primitive type
			int --> float   32bits-->32bits
			byte --> int    8bits-->32bits
			short --> long  16bits-->64bits
		 	long --> byte   64bits-->8bits

			1. Implicit Casting or automatic or widening
				
			2. Explicit Casting or narrowing

	2. Object Casting

Wrapper classes:-

	Primitive type	    Wrapper class            Reference Type
	--------------				     -------------
	byte		-------------------------->    Byte
 	short           -------------------------->    Short
	int 		-------------------------->    Integer
	long		-------------------------->    Long
	float		-------------------------->    Float
	double		-------------------------->    Double
	char		-------------------------->    Character
	boolean		-------------------------->    Boolean

String API:-
============
	* String is a collection of characters.
	  Two ways of creating a string

	  	1. String literal(Immutable)
			String companyName="Revature";

	  	2. String Object(Immutable)
			String companyName=new String("Revature");

		3. StringBuffer(Muttable) -> synchronized(multithreading)
					     Thread safe
					     slow(comapare to 					     stringbuilder)
		4. StringBuilder(Muttable) -> non synchronized
						(Non multithreading)
					      Not thread safe
					      Fast

	* In java Strings are immutable

Pillars of OOPS:-
=================
	* Inheritance  
	   - To drive one class member to the other class
	   - The class which is going to offer its members
	     to other class called parent class or base class
	   - The class which drive the member from other class is called 
	     child class or drive class or subclass
	   - extends 
	     Types of inheritance
		1. Single 
		2. Multilevel
		3. hieraichial 
		4. multiple 
		5. Hybrid
	* polymorphism	
		one thing many form
		one task of many forms
		  sendParcel - task
		  sendParcel(postal)
		  sendParcel(Courier Service)
		  sendParcel(By myself)
		  sendParcel(my friends)
		  sendParcel(relatives)
		Two types of polymorpshim
		
	* abstraction
		* It is hide the complexity and will show only the 		  essentail feature
			
			Car -> hide the complexity
			Essential -> steering,acc,brake, mirror,speed
				     gear
		* If the class is an abstract class you cannot create an
		  object for the class

		public void gear(){ // implemented method or Non abstract
			statements;
		}

		public void gear(); // unimplemented method or abstract
		
	* encapsulation
		- Capsule or bind the data and method together
		- you can code and data together 


Test your code:-
===============
	logic ->  
		class Calculator{
			public int add(int a,int b){
				retrun a+b;
			}
		}
	
			
		System Under Test class(SUT) --> Calculator
		Unit Test:-
			Junit Framework 5 library
			Jupiter test runner - it will run the test cases
			
Exception:-
	
	1. Developer
	   1.1 try catch block
		try{
			statements;// 
		}
		catch(Exceptiontype){   // handler
			statements;
		}
	   1.2 throws	

   Exception Propogation:-

		jdk 7 onwards you can write multiple catch blocks

   resources in java:-
		
		any java code which uses system hardwares those 
		are called as resources

			memory
			cpu
			input
			output
		Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
			keyboard

		FileReader fr=new FileReader("E:/rajesh.txt")
			memory

		s,fr are called as resources
	
			s-----> keyboard
			fr ----> Hard disk(E:/)
		It is a duty to release the resources
			close() ---> Closable() interface
			s.close()
			fr.close()

		jdk 1.7 onwards
			try with resources
Custom Exception:-
==================

	user have to age -> negative age exception
	user asked to enter acc no -> Invalid account exception
	user askes to enter a withdarwl -> InsufficientFund 

	how to create an our own exception
		custome or own checked exception
		
		custome or own checked exception

	1. create an my own exception java class need to extends 
	   either Exception class or RuntimeException
	2. create a one string arg constructor
	public class NegativeAgeException extends RuntimeException {

	String message;

	public NegativeAgeException(String message) {
		super(message);
		this.message = message;
	}

	}

Collection:-
	* Collection are used to store a group objects or references 	  	  inside a single collection variable

	* Dynamic in size 
	
	* Collection API - is build on top of the datastructure algorithm
			Array, Linkedlist,HashTable, Queue, Stack
	
	* Collection has a hirachy -> class, abstract class, interface
				      enums etc
		
	Collection Interface -> abstract method - how to manuplate a group 				object		
		
	List(I) -> allows ordered Collection, accepts a duplicate, 
		   allows null values
		  
		   ArrayList
			-> ordered,accepts a duplicate, accepts null
			-> backed by ds is called array
			-> Random access ->  fast 
			-> when less insertion / deletion
		   LinkedList
			-> ordered,accepts a duplicate, accepts null
			-> backed by ds is called linkedlist
			-> Sequential access
			-> when more insertion / deletion
		   Vector
			-> ordered,accepts a duplicate, accepts null
			-> backed by ds is called array
			-> Multithreading environment
			-> Thread safe(all the methods are syncronized)

java.utility
		Array -> Arrays
		Collection -> Collections

		Comparable(I) and Comparator(I)

	Set(I)->  it is an unordered collection(depends on implmentation), 		  doesnot allow duplicates allows only one null(but 		 		  treeset doesnot even allow one null)

		   HashTable
		
		   HashSet
			-> unordered,doesnot allows duplicate, only one 			 	   null
		   LinkedHashSet
			-> ordered,doesnot allows duplicate, only one 			   	   	   null
		   TreeSet	
			-> Unorder(In Ascending),doesnot allows duplicate, 			   Not even a single null accepted
	Queue(I) - Assoicate have to explore
	
Map<Key,Value>
	Map has key and value pair
	Key and value are object	
	map's contents to be viewed or can iterated in diff ways
	1. set of keys
	2. collection of values
	3. set of key-value mappings
	
	Map<K,V>(I) - it is an unordered collection(depends on 		      implementation),doesnot allow duplicates allows only 		      one null(but treeset doesnot even allow one null)

		HashMap<K,V>:-
			-> Map Key - unordered,doesnot allows duplicate, 			   only one null
		LinkedHashMap<K,V>
			-> Map Key - ordered,doesnot allows duplicate, 			   	   	   only one null
		TreeMap<K,V>
			-> Map Key -Unorder(In Ascending),doesnot allows 			   duplicate,Not even a single null accepted
jdk 1.7
	interface
		- u can have only abstract method	
Jdk 1.8 or jdk 8:-
====================
	Interface can have also implemeneted method:-
	-------------------------------------------
	Default methods interface - instance method
	Static methods inside the interface
	
	Functional Interface:-
	----------------------
	* A interface has only one abstract method then we can say as 	  	  FunctionalInterface
	* A Functional interface can have zero or more implmeneted methods
	  but only one abstract method has to be there in the interface

	Two types of functional interface:-
	---------------------------------
	1. predefined functional interface
		Comparator
		Comparable
		Runnable
		Predicate
		Consumer
		Function
	2. own or custom functional interface
		Eg: Volume 
		    Calculator
	
Lambda Expression:-
-----------------
	* Lambda Expression provides the implmentation of functional           	  interface abstract method
	* It is more concise code
	* It enable Functional Programming 
	* Lambda also called as Anonymous Function(function without name)
	* Functional interface enables you to write lambda expression
	()->{
		System.out.println("show method1");
		System.out.println("show method2");
	}
	
	(a,b)->a+b; // lambda expression 		
	



	Rule for Lamda Expression:-
	1. remove the method name
	2. remove the method return type
	3. remove the method access modifier and nonaccess modifier
	4. after the method () add arrow operator ->
	5. If your lambda has argument then remove the arg type 
	6. If the lambda expression body has only one statement remove the 	   {}
        7. If the lambda expression body has only one statement that too	           return statement then you can remove the return keyword
	
IO stream not a Stream API

Stream API:-
	-> It is going to take a group of object from the source. it 		   perform some operation returns a result
		stream source -> Arrays,Collection,Enums
		1. Source -> streams are created from source
			Array,collection,enums
		2. Intermediate Operation -> operation wanted to perform
			filter,map,sort,min,max etc.,
		3. Terminal Operation -> result
			forEach, collect, count etc.,
	-> streams internally uses lambda and functional interface

	
Collection vs Stream -> associate have to find out
Packages
	java.lang 
	java.util
	java.util.function -> Consumer,Predicate,Function
	java.util -> collection framework
	java.io -> input output classes
		
		FileSystem -> write, read
	
	
		Java Code  <------->  HD (c:/ d:/ e:/ f:/)

	Two Stream are available:-
	1. byte oriented stream (read / write) - image,video,binary
		byte - 1 byte - 8 bits (0 - 127)
		Read -> InputStream
		Write -> OutputStream
	2. character oriented stream (Read / Write) - pdf, text file,xsl	
		char - 2 bytes - 16 bits - (0 - 253)
		Read -> Reader
		Write -> Writer	

Dependency 
==========
		Java Project
			JRE System Library (java creator - oracle)
			add the third library into your project
			How do you 3rd party lib to your project


			Internet you will download:-
			Testing - Junit Framework Library (Third Party)
			Database - Jdbc Driver Library (Third Party)
			Logging - log4j library (Third Party)(someone)

Maven:-
=====
	Maven is a tool that can be used for building and managing any 	Java-based project.
	Maven is also called as project management tool
	Maven is going to manage your project with the help of
	1. Mavan POM file(POM - Project Object Model)
		xml file - very important file maven
 		Maven project configuration and dependencies are handled 		via the Project Object Model, defined in the pom.xml file.
	2. Maven Lifecycle 
	3. Repositories -> all jars or dependencies are collected from 		                           different website kept in a central place
		1. maven local repository
			- The repo is available on your local computer
		2. Maven remote or central repositories
			- The repo is available on internet 
				https://mvnrepository.com/

		maven - create a java project
		      - Simplifies the build process
		      - Adding jars and dependencies
		      - Documenting project information and reports
		      
		  groupid      artifactid	
	Project - clientname , projectname
			irctc -> rail ticket
				 tourism
	Maven Lifecycles:-
	1. Default Lifecycle
		Phases:
		1.1 validate - validate the project is correct and all 				               necessary information is available
		1.2 compile -  compile the source code of the project
		1.3 test - test the compiled source code using a suitable 			           unit testing framework. These tests should not                             require the code be packaged or deployment
		1.4 package - take the compiled code and package it in its 			      distributable format, such as a JAR.
		1.5 verify - run any checks on results of integration 			                     tests to ensure quality criteria are met
		1.6 install - install the package into the local 			                      repository, for use as a dependency in other 			      projects locally
		1.7 deploy - done in the build environment, copies the 			     final package to the remote repository for                              sharing with other developers and projects. 
		
	2. Clean Lifecycle
		2.1 clean - if the jar is already existing it will delete 			    it recreate the jar file again
	3. Site Lifecycle
		2.2 document for your project

					 Everyday - log - logging

	logging     -------------------->  administrator 
					   log file 
	3 Important components of logging Framework:
	--------------------------------------------
	1. logging level -> trace,debug,info,warn,error,fatal
	2. Appenders -> ConsoleAppender,FileAppender,JDBCAppenders,JMSApp
	3. PatternLayout -> date time level message	

	Default logging - error  --> error , fatel
	Appender -> ConsoleAppender
	PatternLayout -> HH:MM:SS.ms [method] level packagename - log 			 message

		FATAL
			Anything at this level means your Java process 			cannot continue and will now terminate.
		ERROR
			A request was aborted and the underlying reason 			requires human intervention ASAP.
		WARN

Design Pattern:-
===============
	* It is a solution to the problem.
	* software developers start writing 
	* For that complexity if the solution is got implemented
	  1. Creational Patterns(Object creation)	
		Singleton
			Employee e1=new Employee();
			Employee e2=new Employee();
			Employee e3=new Employee();
			Employee e4=new Employee();
		Prototype
		Factory Method
		Builder
		Abstract Factory 
	  2. Behavioral Patterns
		
	  3. Structural Patterns
		
	  ref: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/java
	
UI Technologies:-
	website -> collection of webpages
	webpage -> html(content),css(style),js(user interaction)
	
	Html:-(Hyper Text Markup Language)
		- collection html elements and attributes
		- html element surrouded by start tag and end tag
		- start tag <>  end tag</>
		- some are special self closing tag
			<hr>	  
		
		- Html Document <!DCOTYPE html> -> it is going tell 		  browser - what html version used inside document 
		Html Structure
			<html>
				<head>
					<!--Meta info to the browser-->
				</head>

				<body>
					<!--content going to render on the  					browser-->
				</body>
			</html>


		<h1><h1> - headers
		<p></p> - paragraph
		<b></b>
		<strong></strong>
		<i></i>
		<em></em>
		<abbr title="value"></abbr>
		<address>
		<code>
		<ins></ins><u></u>
		<del></del><strike></strike>
		
		<div></div>
			- used to group the html elements

	Html4:- 
		-> UI developer they will div element to divide webpages 
		   into division they will create an website

	HTML5:- new element
		Syntax and semantic tag
		<header></header>
		<section></section>
		<article></article>
		<footer></footer>
		<aside></aside>

	Forms:-
	Used to get input from the user and send it to server

	<form name="login" action="" method="get or post">
		<!-- input controls -->
	</form>
	http://127.0.0.1:5500/registration.html?	firstname=Rajesh&lastname=Nallusamy


	Elements -> inline element
		    block element

	elements
	<img src="" height="" width=""></img>
	<p style=""></p>

	attribute -> key = value

CSS (Cascading style sheet):-
	- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
	- it is a language for styling HTML documents 
	- by specifying certain style rules for layout and display 
	- style rule - key:value pairs
	- It used to style the webpages by setting background-color, font 		  color, font size, font family, etc.
	
	* A CSS consists of a set of rules that defines the styles for a 	  	  web page
	* CSS style rule composed of 
		1. selectors 
		2. declarations
	
		selectors{
			key:value;
			key:value;
			key:value;
		}

		Eg:-
		 h3 { 
       			font-family: Arial; 
       			font-style: italic; 
       			color: red;
       		 }

CSS can be written in 3 ways to style a webpage:-
		1. inline css 
		2. Embedded css or internal css
		3. external css

CSS Selectors:-
	1. element selecetor
	2. class selector
	3. id selector
	
CSS Box layout:
	margin - invisible -> top, left, right, bottom 
	border - visible - type, color, size, top, left, right, bottom 
	padding - invisible -> top, left, right, bottom
	content - display content

	block level elements -> margin, border, padding
				height
				width
				top
				left
				bottom
				right

Javascript:-
***********
	JavaScript is the most popular and widely used client-side 			scripting language. 
	Client-side scripting refers to scripts that run within your web 		browser. 
	JavaScript is designed to add interactivity and dynamic effects to 	the web pages by manipulating the content returned from a web 			server.
	
	
	What JS do:-
	-----------
	You can modify the content of a web page by adding or removing 			elements.
	You can change the style and position of the elements on a web 			page.
	You can monitor events like mouse click, hover, etc. and react to 		it.
	You can perform and control transitions and animations.
	You can create alert pop-ups to display info or warning messages 		to the user.
	You can perform operations based on user inputs and display the 		results.
	You can validate user inputs before submitting it to the server.
	
	From 2015 onwards
		Node.js - server side script

	Javascript variable naming convention:-
	======================================
	A javascript variable is case sensitive
	A variable name must start with a letter, underscore (_), or 			dollar sign ($).
	A variable name cannot start with a number.
	A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters (A-z, 0		-9) and underscores.
	A variable name cannot contain spaces.
	A variable name cannot be a JavaScript keyword or a JavaScript 			reserved word.

	Data Types in JavaScript:-
	========================
	Data types basically specify what kind of data can be stored and 		manipulated within a variable .

	There are six basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided 		into three main categories: 
	1. primitive (or primary) - string,number,boolean
	2. composite (or reference) - Object, Array, Function
	3. special data types - undefined and null.

	Primitive data types can hold only one value at a time
 	composite data types can hold collections of values and more 			complex entities.


	function mathodname(parameter)
	{
		// code	
	}
	
	var g; // variable declaration

	g="sdgfhd";

	g=67; 


	JS -> it is not strict type language. Loosly typed language

		datatype variable;
	js Array:-
		var a=[346,676,34,"rajesh",true,null];

	js object  -> property
		   -> key:value 
		   -> if u have more than one property then each property 		      sererated by (,) 			
Variable Scope:
	The Variable scope defines the lifetime and visibility of a 	variable. 
	Each variable associated with a scope. 
	The variable can be accessed only within its scope.
	1. Global variable
		- outside of any function, block , module
	2. Function scope
		function name{
			var a; // function scope
		}	
	3. local scope
		{
			var a;
		}
	5. block scope
		{
			let a;
			const a;
		}
		var 
		ECMA 2015 or ES6 -> let, const
			
JavaScript is a loosely typed scripting language. JavaScript allows strictness of code by using "use strict"; statement at the top of JavaScript code or in a function.	

The strict mode in JavaScript does not allow us to use 
	undefined variables
	reserved keywords as variable or function name
	duplicate properties of an object
	duplicate parameters of the function
	assign values to read-only properties
	Modifying arguments object
	Deleting an undeletable property.	

DM tree API:-
	getElementById("idname")
	getElementByName("name");
	getElementsByTagName("htmlelement")
	getElementsByClassName("classname")	
	

Javascript --------> ECMA -> ECMAScript(standard for scripting)
	
Responsive Design:
	* viewport width
	* CSS Media queries - breakpoints
	* flex grid layout and flex box
	* always relative units %,em,vh,vw

Bootstrap:-
	
	* UI framework for responsive web page
	* fastest developement
	
	 - css ->  bootstrap.min.css (styles)

Git:-
	Git is a free and open-source version control system
	
	git command
		git --version
		git init - intialize and create a local repository
		git status 
		git add filepath
		git commit -m "commit message"
		git branch

Process -> .exe
	 -> Process - word -> HD c:/pf/windows/office/winword
		winword.exe
	 ->     mspaint.exe
		chrome.exe
		fifafootball.exe
		java.exe
		

	HD----------------> RAM -----------------> Processor
